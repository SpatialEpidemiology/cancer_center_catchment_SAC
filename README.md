Spatial access to care in NCI-designated Cancer Center Catchment Areas

NCI-designated cancer centers catchment areas are geographic regions that cancer centers are mandated to assess and serve. Previous research has not quantified spatial access to health care providers within NCI-designated cancer center catchment areas, and instead has focused on spatial access to cancer center campuses. This repository contains data, codebooks, figures, and tables for a project examining spatial access to oncology, cancer care, and primary care providers in cancer center catchment areas.
